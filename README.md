## AI Problem Solving with Blind Search Algorithms

The goal of this assignment is to solve an AI problem using search techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS). Similar to your previous project, you will work with an AI agent that interacts with a simulated street network environment built on a real-world street map.

You will complete the implementation of different blind search strategies, including <b>BFS, DFS,</b>b> and <b>UCS</b>. Note that you are provided with an implementation that is essentially Breadth-First Search. Your task is to extend this implementation to support the remaining search strategies and finish the associated tasks.
Your implementation may rely on several useful data structures, such as <i>deque, set</i>, and <i>priority queue</i>. In class, we have already practiced the basic functionalities of these data structures. Here are the links to the scripts we worked on in class, which might be helpful:
